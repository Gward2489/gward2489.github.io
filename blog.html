            I have never blogged, but now I have some blog action going on. My first week at NSS is going well.
            We have worked on a lot of cool and interesting concepts already. I completed the overly excited function 
            and then got overly excited myself.

            NSS is pretty interesting so far. I definately have my work cut out for me. Hopefully, I will be able
            to fake it until I make it.
